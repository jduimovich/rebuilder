# Rebuilder
 
This application will watch for component git repo changes and trigger an auto-rebuild if the git repo changes.

- Import this into stone soup. 
- Goto the web page when its built and running. You need to provide a token for access and your container will be able to build automatically when it detects your image has changed.
